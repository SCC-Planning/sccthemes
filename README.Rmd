The goal of sccthemes is to provide a consistent styling framework and helper functions for graphics made in ggplot at the Suffolk County Council.

This package has been heavily inspired by [bbplot](https://github.com/bbc/bbplot), the BBC's R package for creating and exporting graphics made in ggplot.

## Installation

You can install the development version of sccthemes from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("thomaszwagerman/sccthemes")
```
