The goal of sccthemes is to provide a consistent styling framework and helper functions for graphics made in ggplot at the Suffolk County Council.

This package has been heavily inspired by [bbplot](https://github.com/bbc/bbplot), the BBC's R package for creating and exporting graphics made in ggplot.

This cookbook is a work in progress. The BBC's ["ggplot cookbook"](https://bbc.github.io/rcookbook/#make_a_bar_chart) is a good starting point to use as a reference.
